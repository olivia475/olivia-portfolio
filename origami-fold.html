						<h3>1. Research & Ideation</h3>
							<p class="padding-left">
								<em>- THEME:</em> Legendary, Luxury, Timeless, Youthful<br>

								<em>- TEA FLAVOR PROFILE:</em> Vanilla rooibos, bergamot, orange zest, tangerine<br><br>
							</p>

							</div>

							<p class="padding-left">
								<em>- LADYBUG IMAGERY:</em> There is a belief that the sighting of a ladybug foreshadows a bout of good luck, and can represent new beginnings, and so my initial ideas included ladybugs so that anyone who opens this product would gain that "bout of good luck".<br><br>

								<em>- HONG KONG ORCHID IMAGERY:</em> Flora from the Hong Kong Orchid Tree serves as a symbol not only beauty and elegance, but also of Hong Kong itself. This flower is featured on the Hong Kong flag, as well as their coins.<br>
									The gestural flowers are organized into a circular rhythmic pattern to reference the cycle of growth, made of an even 8 flowers <em>(the client requested to consider the number "8" while formatting).</em><br><br>

						<h3>2. Mockups & Critque</h3>
							<p class="padding-left">
								Throughout this design process I continuously seeked input and critique from both designers within TEALEAVES and from the contact at Grand Hyatt.<br><br>
								
								This input pushed the design through multiple iterations (especially for the interior design).

								The exterior design was positively received first time around (a very rare occurence!), so the second version consists of only a colour switch.

							<h3>Interior</h3>
							<p class="padding-left">
								The interior became more simplified as the versions progressed. Initial design included orange slices (to compliment the teas orange zest and tangerine flavours) and ladybugs (to symbolize good luck), however both were removed in the final design.

                <h3 class="padding-left">Takeaways</h3>
				<p class="padding-left">
					Besides improving upon my skills in Illustrator and Procreate, this project also helped me improve communication skills with clients. The process of this design included a lot of back and forth with the TEALEAVES connection at Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, allowing their comments taken into consideration throughout the iterations of designs.<br><br>
					
					For future projects, I plan to practice having more variety of ideas during the initial brainstorming period. I got fixated on trying to get one idea to be perfect (the interior with the flowers and insects), instead of freely sketching a varitey of designs.
